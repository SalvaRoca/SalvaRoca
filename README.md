### Hello, welcome to my GitHub profile!

## 👨🏻‍💻 Who am I?

My name is **Salva Roca**, it's great to have you around!👋🏼

I started studying Industrial Engineering in 2011 at the Technical University of Cartagena (Murcia, Spain) and began my professional career in Project Management in August 2015, before completing my Master's Degree in 2017. Since then, I have not stopped developing myself personally and professionally by:

* 💼 Working for more than 7 years as a **Project Manager** in diverse international highly-regulated industries, such as:
  - Automated Manufacturing Equipment
  - Aerospace and Military
  - Renewable Energies
  - Bio-pharmaceuticals

* 📖 Learning new hard and soft **skills**:
  - Leadership and Team Management ([MBA](https://eneb.com/master-and-postgraduate/mba-_-master-in-management-and-team-management/) and [other courses](https://courses.edx.org/certificates/f3b47e825d3448819a25cbb0ced65da2))
  - Scrum and Project Management ([Courses](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/engineering-project-management) and continuous training)
  - Data Science and Analytics ([Master's Degree](https://formacionhadoop.com/producto/master-online-big-data-analytics/) and [other courses](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science))
 
* 🎖️ Earning relevant **certifications** that endorse my knowledge and experience:
  - [Project Management Professional (PMP)®](https://www.credly.com/badges/5d789b35-8d89-492d-8b1c-6b0f458142dc)
  - [Professional Scrum Master™ I (PSM I)](https://www.credly.com/badges/78c10225-0f6c-41eb-9646-6e745a3e95d6)
  

## 🔭 Where am I today?

After all these years, I feel that I am in complete control of any project I am given. In search of new challenges, I started exploring Full-Stack web development on my own and discovered an interesting world, full of exciting opportunities. That's why I enrolled a [Full-Stack Development learning path provided by IBM](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-full-stack-cloud-developer), which helped me develop a basic skill set with the following technologies:

* Front-End
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - JavaScript
  - React.js + Redux
  - Bootstrap
* Back-End
  - Node.js
  - Express.js
  - Python
  - Flask
  - Django + PostgreSQL
* Version Control
  - git
  - GitHub
* Containerization
  - Docker
  - Kubernetes
  - RedHat Openshift
* Microservices, serverless and cloud computing


## 💬 Want to know more?

In that case, you should know that cannot understand life without music. I have been playing the bass guitar since 2008, in different bands and on my own. I also enjoy grinding myself in the gym and play videogames, both always better with friends.

If you want to reach me for any professional project or collab, do not hesitate to contact me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/salvaroca/) and I'll be glad to answer as soon as possible.
